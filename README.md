# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to showcase my web scraping ability to be added to my portfolio that will hopefully influence future  
employers' confidence in me to handle web scraping projects.  

## Tools used for this project  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- VS Code
- Python  
- Chrome Developer  
- Beautiful Soup  
- Splinter  
- Bootstrap  
- Mongo DB  
- Flask  

## Overview of Project  
- Locate, Inspect, and Parse the data to be scraped using 
    - Scrape News, Featured Image, Facts, High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images  
- Store data in Mongo DB  
- Create and Update HTML using CSS styling and Bootstrap  
- Create an application using Flask  

## Summation  
The end result is a cleanly formatted scrapable application that will allow the end-user to (with the click of a button) get the most  
up-to-date Mars news and facts, as well as, view photos of the four Mars hemispheres.  

Although this was new for me, I was able to accomplish it and have a strong confidence that I could perform data scraping to retrieve information relevant to any company's needs.
